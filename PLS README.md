# To all visitors who isn't the intended viewer please ignore this. Sorry I didn't add 2nd page I tried to get local storage to work for 6 hours but couldn't figure it out so I put a working local storage code in and that worked but when I modified to work with this code it still returned undifined. Again sorry about that but that is the reason why their is no 2nd page.
